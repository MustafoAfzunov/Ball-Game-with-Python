# Python Ball Game with Vectors

This project is an interactive ball game built using Python, vector mathematics, and the `simplegui` library. In this game, a ball moves around the screen, and the player can interact with it. The movement is calculated using vectors, and the game offers basic interaction features like bouncing and controlling the ball's speed or direction.

## Game Features

- **Ball movement**: The ball moves across the canvas based on vector calculations.
- **Interactivity**: Players can interact with the ball by clicking or controlling it using the mouse/keyboard.
- **Bouncing effect**: The ball bounces when it reaches the edges of the screen.
- **Vector physics**: Ball movement is determined using vectors for position and velocity.

## Requirements

To run this game, you need to install the `simplegui` library, which is part of the **CodeSkulptor** environment, but you can install a Python version of it using the following package:

```bash
pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame
